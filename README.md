# I hate md files.
This is just the sources for my website. If
you like the quax client try coding a client and sending it to my
email: mailme@sethestudio.com
# how to use
You cannot use any code in this for any of your purposes.
# You: why?
Because this code has some sensitive information transfered by my client to my server.
# You: Please?
No. My client tells my server that it is my client not vanilla or fml minecraft.
This allows me to know if you are not hacking
but if I give the source code you will find out how 
my client communicates with my server
and you will add it in a hacked client
to allow cheating on my server. So
the answer is NO.
# Where is my server?
Well I normally host it locally so I can put the custom plugin
that detects whether its my client but
I currently do not have a hosting platform.
# Server Hosting Platforms:
Aternos: Easy hosting but no custom plugins or bungeecord.
Freemcserver: Custom Plugins and Bungeecord but hard hosting.
Apexmc: Not free.
# Do you know anything free?
If you know any free hosting services which allow ftp
and is easy to use.
